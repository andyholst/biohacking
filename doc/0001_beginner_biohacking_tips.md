## Biohacking core steps

### Mitochondria

- Environmental sensors
- Ancient bacteria, melded with cells
- Make power
- Sensitive to environment around you
- Make proteins
- Makes hormones
- Makes neurotransmitters
- Make power
- Make inflammation
- Polyphenols to boost mitochondria with help of coffee etc
- Quorum sensing, each mitochondria adjust their behaviour to the neighboring mitochondria cells
- Hack your mitochondria with technology to get the proper behaviour if lacking natural light, natural environment

#### Intermittent fasting

- Improves memory
- Brightens mood
- Reduces inflammation
- Fights high blood sugar

- Glycos goes down (sugar level), antiaging effect

- Reduce cortisol
- Reduce inflammation
- Reduce disconnection syndrome

#### Block junk light

- Block blue light glasses

#### Exposure to sun light or artificial light by photobiomodulation devices

- Red and near infra-red light devices
